# Implementation of Word-Level Language Detection Text-to-Speech

## Overview
This feature enhances the Chorus module by detecting the language of each word in a text and generating speech with proper pronunciation for multilingual content. 

## Features
- Automatically detects language for each word in the input text
- Generates speech with correct pronunciation based on the detected language
- Currently supports: English, French, Spanish, and German
- Provides a user-friendly interface for multilingual text-to-speech

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components
- `/api/texttospeech` endpoint processes text and generates speech
- Language detection using both dictionary-based and character pattern-based approaches
- Audio generation using gTTS with language-specific settings
- Returns base64-encoded audio for browser playback

### Frontend Components
- Updated `ChorusPage.tsx` with language detection information
- Modified `speechService.ts` to call the custom TTS endpoint
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Improved logging for debugging

## Testing
- Created test HTML page at `/static/language-test.html` for direct API testing
- Developed `test_language_detection.py` script to verify functionality
- Generated test audio files from multilingual phrases
- Verified language detection accuracy

## Next Steps
- Add support for more languages
- Optimize language detection algorithm for better accuracy
- Improve handling of mixed-language phrases
- Add user-selectable voice options for each language

## Technical Notes
- Language detection uses both word dictionaries and character pattern recognition
- For unknown words, falls back to English pronunciation
- Returns audio as base64-encoded string for direct browser playback
- Built with Flask backend and React frontend
